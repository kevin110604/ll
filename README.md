This project implements a thread-safe linked list for the C language. The API is intended
to be intuitive and simple as well as robust and useful. The data in the linked-list is
stored as a `void *`. The user is not exposed to any of the underlying implementation (no
access to nodes). The mutex on a linked-list, however, is exposed, so the user has access
to that if need be.

## Installing

Running

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/r-medina/ll.git && cd ./ll/ && make o && cd ..
```

will download this project and build the object code in `ll/obj/`, which can then be
linked or whatever.

`make exec` will build the executable that has the tests.

## Examples

## API

The `include/ll.h` documents all the features to which a user has access.

### Data Structure

The data structure that governs this project is a simple singly-linked-list with a
reader/writer mutex. The two functional attributes help the user print their linked list
and deconstruct the elements.

```c
// linked list
struct ll {
    // running length
    int len;

    // pointer to the first node
    ll_node_t *hd;

    // mutex for thread safety
    pthread_rwlock_t m;

    // a function that is called every time a value is deleted
    // with a pointer to that value
    gen_fun_t val_teardown;

    // a function that can print the values in a linked list
    gen_fun_t val_printer;
};
```

### Functions

```c
// returns a pointer to an allocated linked list.
// needs a taredown function that is called with
// a pointer to the value when it is being deleted.
ll_t *ll_new(gen_fun_t val_teardown);

// traverses the linked list, deallocated everything (including `list`)
void ll_delete(ll_t *list);

// inserts a value into the linked list at position `n`. acceptable values for n are `0`
// (puts it in first) to `list->len` (puts it in last).
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_insert_n(ll_t *list, void *val, int n);

// puts a value at the front of the linked list.
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_insert_first(ll_t *list, void *val);

// puts a value at the end of the linked list.
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_insert_last(ll_t *list, void *val);

// removes the value at position n of the linked list.
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_remove_n(ll_t *list, int n);

// removes the value at the front of the linked list.
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_remove_first(ll_t *list);

// given a function that tests the values in the linked list, the first element that
// satisfies that function is removed.
// returns the new length of the linked list if successful, -1 otherwise
int ll_remove_search(ll_t *list, int cond(void *));

// returns a pointer to the `n`th value in the linked list.
// returns `NULL` if unsuccessful
void *ll_get_n(ll_t *list, int n);

// returns a pointer to the first value in a linked list.
// `NULL` if empty
void *ll_get_first(ll_t *list);

// runs f on all values of list
void ll_map(ll_t *list, gen_fun_t f);

// goes through all the values of a linked list and calls `list->val_printer` on them
void ll_print(ll_t list);

// a generic taredown function for values that don't need anything done
void ll_no_teardown(void *n);
```
